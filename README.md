## üéÆ Project Overview

This project is a complete implementation of the classic Pong game, featuring:
- Two-player gameplay
- Score tracking
- Ball physics with bouncing mechanics
- Responsive paddle controls
- Visual feedback for scoring

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smooth Gameplay**: Responsive controls and fluid animations
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of each player's score
- **Collision Detection**: Realistic ball bouncing off walls and paddles
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean, modular code structure
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify game parameters like speed and scoring
